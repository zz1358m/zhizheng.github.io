I am a first-year Ph.D. student from [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research interests include AI for Application, Neural combinatorial Optimization, and Machine Learning. 

Previously, I finished my undergraduate studies at the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, and was honored to be advised by [Prof. Zhenkun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9ezy2gAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Xin Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UUtYPl4AAAAJ), and [Prof. Ke Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mzLHFbAAAAAJ&hl=en).

My CV is here: [Zhi Zheng's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Zhi_Zheng.pdf).
